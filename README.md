# Wordle Clone (Backend-Only)
## About
This is a backend-only Wordle clone created for educational and personal purposes. It replicates the functionality of the original Wordle game, with text-based gameplay implemented in Python. The game uses the random module for word selection and the colorama library for terminal-based color feedback.

Features
Classic Wordle gameplay in the terminal:
  - Guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts.
  - Feedback is provided via colored text:
    - Green: Correct letter in the correct position.
    - Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position.
    - Red: Incorrect letter.
Random word selection from a predefined word list.
